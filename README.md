# Towny

Towny is a java dwarf fortress-style game, where you manage a group of villagers stranded in the wilderness.
Feel free to contribute to the game by fixing my terrible code, or adding new features.

## Mac os
Running the game on mac requires you to put `-XstartOnFirstThread -Djava.awt.headless=true` in the VM options in your launch config.
